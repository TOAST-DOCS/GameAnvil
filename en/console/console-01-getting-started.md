## Before Starting

Game server operations begin by deploying developed server binary to physical devices of the desired size and running them to the desired logical configuration. They also require monitoring, binary management, patch support and etc. GameAnvil console meets all of these requirements. This document describes how to deploy and operate game servers implemented using GameAnvil on the console.

| Server binary | A .jar file that can be run as a server process on a server instance. The corresponding binary contains the code for all nodes that you implement.                                                                                                             |
| Server process | The process of running the game server, i.e. running the server binary.                                                                                                                                                  |

| Game server   | It is an abstract term that encompasses the server instance on which the server binary is deployed or the entire server instance that is already process-run. In other words, a combination of physical equipment + binary for game services. GameAnvil manages server instances and server processes as a single concept. It is abbreviated to be called as "server" in documents and console menus. |
| Server      | It has the same meaning as game server                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Node      | Functional units that make up a single server process. One server process can consist of one or more nodes (see Server Development Guide for details)                                                                                                           |
