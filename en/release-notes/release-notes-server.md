## Game > GameAnvil > Release Note > GameAnvil
### 1.4.2 (2024.02.26)

#### New
* Improved Safe-Pause feature. 
  * Even if Safe-Pause is already in progress, improvements have been made to run new Safe-Pause by designating non-in-progress nodes as origin/destination nodes. 
  * In addition to GameNode, MatchNode also supports Safe-Pause. 

#### Fix
* Enhanced and improved the readability of the engine's logs. 
  * Added more information about the packets sent when a request fails.
  * Separated the markers for system information logs from a single SYSTEM_INFO to SYSTEM_INFO and SYSTEM_WARN.
  * Modified to log which requests failed when individual requests failed in MultiRequest
  * Enhanced logs related to machine-to-machine connection status. 

#### Change
* Modified GameAnvilConfig.json to enable managementPort as well as managementIp.

------

### 1.4.1 (2023.12.13)

#### New
###### Updated engine Protobuf version to 3.24.1
###### Added Protobuf-related convenience features
  * You can use Protobuf directly in send, reply.
  * You can change packets directly to Protobuf (`MyProto.MyMessageResMsg =resPacket.toProtoBufferMessage();`)
  * In most situations, it works normally without calling a retain release.
###### When registering for Protocol, we have improved so that you don't need to specify an index. 
  * Existing numbers are automatically assigned by the engine.

#### Fix
* Improved the server to give an immediate failure response if no target is found when making a request.
    * Improved the engine's request APIs, such as requestToGameUser, to return a failure immediately if the target is not found, instead of waiting for a timeout.
* Enhanced engine log content and readability
    * We systematically separated both DEBUG and TRACE levels in the engine log and organized the contents to make it easier to understand.
    * Enhanced the log content of the engine related to the user.
    * Improved some engine error messages to make them easier to understand.
* Improved management nodes to only run together when a location node is configured.
    * Because the management node runs automatically in the location node configuration location, you no longer need to set it up and manage it yourself and you don't need to worry about the order of operations.
* Improved the response to incorrect channelIDs during the login process.
    * Modified to give a login failure response instead of a vague SystemError response, which is clearer.
* Improved the server to handle errors and pass responses to the client if an unregistered protocol is passed to the game server in the payload.
    * In the case of leaving only the WARN logs on the existing server, there is a problem that the logs may be missed during the debugging process, so we improved it to forward the response to the client.
* Provides new HttpClient2 based on Apache HttpComponent.
    * Because existing AsyncHttpClient open sources are no longer updated, we provide a new library-based HttpClient2 for optional use.
* Support for compressed packets in the payload.
    * It has been now improved that the availability of compressed packets for payloads as well.
* It forwards notifications to the client when matchmaking fails.
    * Improved delivery of appropriate results to clients even when matchmaking fails.

#### Change
* Set
    * GameAnvilConfig.json uses ipcIp and managementIp instead of ip entries.
    * We fixed an issue that did not serialize successfully in BaseChannelInfo. Instead of BaseChannelInfo, you can serialize by calling the setObjectSerializer in GameAnvilServer.
* It does not include Payload when calling matchUser, matchParty. It keeps it on its own.
 * It is fixed so that all location nodes (master nodes) can only send requests to location nodes after clustering is complete. And added the feature to ensure that all location nodes are clustered and to leave an error log if the entire clustering is not completed within a certain time.
 * During user matching, it was changed from the existing method in which matched rooms were created in random channels to the method in which matched rooms were created among the channels requested for matching.
  
------

### 1.3.1 (2023.04.20)

#### New

#### Fix

* Fixed the issue that the channel information of the newly started node is not updated

#### Change

- Changed the Active Status Check API for the Support node that you see in the Console
- Changed the Management node to start only on the server where the location node is set up

------

### 1.3.0 (2022.12.27)

#### New

###### Syncing with Console 1.3 
GameAnvil 1.3 works perfectly with the completely new Console 1.3. through the console, you can intuitively manage the status of each node and issue commands. You can conveniently try features such as proceeding with SafePause or creating and removing specific nodes through the console.
</br> â€» Earlier versions of GameAnvil are not available in Console 1.3.

###### Easy-to-use synchronization feature
The convenience of integrating with the Unity engine has been greatly enhanced by the provision of synchronization components. Without the complex implementation of logic on the server, various elements of the game object are automatically synchronized between remote clients.

* Create GameObject, automatically synchronize destruction
* Synchronize Animation
* Synchronize Transform
* Synchronize RigidBody and RigidBody2D
* Custom value synchronization feature

###### Optimize Performance
GameAnvil 1.3 improves packet processing by more than 5% compare to previous versions. It operates at a faster rate by optimizing the internal action code.
