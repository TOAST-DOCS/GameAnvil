## GameAnvilUser

GameAnvilUser is responsible for tasks related to GameNodes on the GameAnvil server. It provides basic features, such as Login (), Logout (), and Room Management. Based on a directly defined protocol, the client can send and receive messages to other objects through its user objects and implement various contents.

GameAnvilManager provides a GameAnvilUserController to manage one GameAnvilUser generated by the quick login process by default. It can be obtained through the UserController for LoginResult.

### Login

Logging can be defined as the process of creating its own user objects on GameNode after the client connects to the server.

Since login is processed in one step with the simple login function, its explanation will be omitted. For more information, see the [In-depth Development Guide to Unity > User](../unity-advanced/unity-advanced-03-user.md).

### Logout

In GameAnvilManager, you log out of the game server and it is automatically processed until the connection is terminated. For more information about logout, see the [In-depth Development Guide to Unity > User](../unity-advanced/unity-advanced-03-user.md).

### Create, Enter, Leave Room

Two or more users can create a synchronized message flow through the room. It means that users' requests are guaranteed to be orderly all inside the room. Creating rooms for one user, of course, can have meaning depending on the content. How to use a room is up to the engine user.

#### CreateRoom

Create a room by calling CreateRoom() and entering the room.

\`\`\`c# public async void ManagerCreateRoom() { GameAnvilManager gameAnvilManager = GameAnvilManager.Instance; GameAnvilUserController userController = gameAnvilManager.UserController;
    
    try
    {
        Payload createRoomPayload = new Payload(new Protocol.CreateRoomData());
        ErrorResult<ResultCodeCreateRoom, CreatedRoomResult> result = await userControll.CreateRoom("RoomName", "RoomType", "MatchingGroup", createRoomPayload);
        if (result.ErrorCode == ResultCodeCreateRoom.CREATE_ROOM_SUCCESS)
        {
            // Success
        } else
        {
            // Failure
        }
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        // Exception
    }
} \`\`\`

CreateRoom() has the following four parameters:

| Type | Name | Description |
|--------- |--------------- |--------------------------------------- |
| String | roomName | Name of the room to create. If not used, enter string.Empty |
| String | roomType | Type of the room to create. Enter the room type registered on the server |
| String | matchingGroup | Matching group name to use when matching. If not used, enter string.Empty (empty string) |
| Payload | payload | Additional information required from the user code of the server to process the room creation request. (default = null) |

In response, ErrorResult<ResultCodeCreateRoom, CreatedRoomResult> will be returned, and you can check the values in the ErrorCode field to see if they are successful. If CreateRoom succeeds, the value in the ErrorCode field will be ResultCodeCreateRoom.CREATE\_ROOM\_SUCCESS, and if not, the creation of a room will fail. You can get the CreatedRoomResult result of your request through the Data field. It allows you to get the information of the created rooms, and you can also get additional information depending on the server implementation.

### Matchmaking

GameAnvil provides two mainly matchmaking: One is room matching that performs matches in room units, and the other is user matching that performs matches in user units.

#### Room Matchmaking

Room matchmaking is a method to get the users into a room that suits their conditions. If you have a room that meets the conditions, you will immediately enter the room. If no room meets the conditions, you will create and register a new room.

You can call MatchRoom() to request room matchmaking.

```c# public async void ManagerMatchRoom() { GameAnvilManager gameAnvilManager = GameAnvilManager.Instance; GameAnvilUserController userController = gameAnvilManager.UserController; try { var matchRoomPayload = new Payload(new Protocol.MatchRoomData()); ErrorResult<ResultCodeMatchRoom, MatchResult> result = await userController.MatchRoom(true, true, "RoomType", "MatchingGroup", "MatchingUserCategory", matchRoomPayload); if (result.ErrorCode == ResultCodeMatchRoom.MATCH_ROOM_SUCCESS) { // 성공 } else { // 실패 } } catch (Exception e) { // 예외 } } ```

MatchRoom() has the following 7 parameters:

| Type | Name | Description |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bool | isCreateRoomIfNotJoinRoom | When a room that meets the conditions cannot be found, whether to create a room and enter it. <br/>true : Create if there is no room. <br/>false : If there is no room, it is considered a failure. |
| bool | isMoveRoomIfJoinedRoom | If you already have entered the room, whether to move to another room. <br/>true : If you're in the room, move the room. <br/>false : If you request a match as you are in the room, it will fail. | string | roomType | Room Type. Find the same type of room |
| string | matchingGroup | matching group. Find the room created by the same group. |
| string | matchingUserCategory | Usage user category in matched rooms.<br/>In each room, you can divide the users in the room by category, with an individual room limit applied for each category. Finds rooms with a specified matchingUserCategory that doesn't have the maximum number of users. |
| Payload | payload | Additional information required by the server's user code to process the matchmaking request. (default = null) |
| Payload | leaveRoomPayload | Additional information required by the server's user code to process the room exit when moving to a different room. (default = null) |

In response, ErrorResult<ResultCodeMatchRoom, MatchResult> will be returned, and you can check the values in the ErrorCode field to see if they are successful. If MatchRoom succeeds, the value in the ErrorCode field will be ResultCodeMatchRoom.NAMED\_ROOM\_SUCCESS, and if not, the entry or creation will fail. You can get MatchResult of the request result through the Data field. It allows you to get information about the rooms you entered or created, and you can also get additional information depending on the server implementation.

ResultCodeMatchRoom details are as follows:

| Name | Value | Description |
|------------------------------------------------ |----- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | PARSE\_ERROR | -2 | Packet Parsing Error. This can occur if the server and client versions are different. |
| TIMEOUT | -1 | Timeout. The request will not be responded within the set time. |

| bool | IsCancel | Whether the request was canceled. |
| int | RoomId | ID of the room you entered. |
| bool | Created | Whether a new room has been created. |
| String | RoomName | Name of the room you entered. |
| Payload? | payload | Additional information required by the client.

#### User Matchmaking

User matchmaking is to create a user pool and find the appropriate users in it to get into the newly created room. If the number of users matching the conditions in the user pool is low, it may take time for the matching to complete, and if the matching is not completed within time, the matching may fail over time.

You can call MatchUserStart() to start user matching. Even if the request was successful, the user matchmaking has not been completed. The single start request succeeded, and the result of the matches will be delivered via separate callbacks.

```c# public async void ManagerMatchUserStart() { GameAnvilManager gameAnvilManager = GameAnvilManager.Instance; GameAnvilUserController userController = gameAnvilManager.UserController; userController.OnMatchUserDone += (GameAnvilUserController userController, ResultCodeMatchUserDone resultCode, MatchResult matchResult) => { // 매칭 성공 }; userController.OnMatchUserTimeout += (GameAnvilUserController userController) => { // 매칭 실패 }; try { Payload matchUserPayload = new Payload(new Protocol.MatchUserData()); ErrorResult<ResultCodeMatchUserStart, Payload> result = await gameAnvilManager.UserController.MatchUserStart("RoomType", "MatchingGroup", matchUserPayload); if(result.ErrorCode == ResultCodeMatchUserStart.MATCH_USER_START_SUCCESS) { // 요청 성공 } else { // 실패 } } catch (Exception e) { // 예외 } } ```

MatchUserStart() has the following three parameters:

| Type | Name | Description |
|--------- |--------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| String | roomType | Type of room to be created. |
| String | matchingGroup | Matching Group. Find the appropriate user in the user pool of the same group. If not enabled, enter string.Empty (empty string) |
 Payload | payload | Additional information required from the user code of the server on which the user matchmaking request is to be processed. (default = null) |

In response, ErrorResult<ResultCodeMatchUserStart, Payload> will be returned, and you can check the value in the ErrorCode field to see if it succeeds. If MatchUserStart succeeds, the value in the ErrorCode field is ResultCodeMatchUserStart.MATCH\_USER\_START\_SUCCESS, and if not, user matching will fail. Depending on the server implementation, you can also get additional information through Payload in the Data field.

ResultCodeMatchUserStart details are as follows:

| Name | Value | Description |
|--------------------------- |---- |---------------------------- |
| PARSE\_ERROR | -2 | Packet Parsing Error. This can occur if the server and client versions are different. |
| TIMEOUT | -1 | Timeout. The request will not be responded within the set time. |
| SYSTEM\_ERROR | 1 | Server System Error. Failed due to an unknown server error. |
| INVALID\_PROTOCOL | 2 | Protocol unregistered on the server. An unregistered protocol was used in the additional information. |
| MATCH\_USER\_START\_SUCCESS | 0 | success. |
| MATCH\_USER\_START\_FAIL\_CONTENT | 1101 | Failed. User code denied. |
| MATCH\_USER\_START\_FAIL\_ALREADY\_JOINED\_ROOM | 1102 | Failed. Already in the room. |

<br>

If user matchmaking succeeds, you can receive notification through onMatchUserDone. You can know the result code through the Parameter ResultCodeMatchUserDone resultCode , and you can get information about the matched rooms through the Parameter MatchResult matchResult. Depending on the server implementation, you can also get additional information through the payload in MatchResult. If matching fails within time, you can be notified through onMatchUserTimeout.

The details of ResultCodeMatchUserDone are as follows:

| Name | Value | Description |
|-------------------------- |---- |----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PARSE\_ERROR | -2 | Packet Parsing Error. This can occur if the server and client versions are different. |
| TIMEOUT | -1 | Timeout. The request will not be responded within the set time. |
| SYSTEM\_ERROR | 1 | Server System Error. Failed due to an unknown server error. |
| INVALID\_PROTOCOL | 2 | Protocol unregistered on the server. An unregistered protocol was used in the additional information. |
| MATCH\_USER\_DONE\_SUCCESS | 0 | success. |
| MATCH\_USER\_DONE\_FAIL\_CONTENT | 1501 | Failed. User code denied. |
| MATCH\_USER\_DONE\_FAIL\_ROOM\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST | 1502 | Failed. While looking for a room for your condition, the room disappeared. | MATCH\_USER\_DONE\_FAIL\_TRANSFER | 1503 | Failed. Failed to transfer to join the room while looking for a room that meets the conditions |
| MATCH\_USER\_DONE\_FAIL\_CREATE\_ROOM | 1504 | Failed. Creating room failed. |

<br>

You can call MatchUserCancel() to cancel ongoing user matches.

```c# public async void ManagerMatchUserCancel() { GameAnvilManager gameAnvilManager = GameAnvilManager.Instance; GameAnvilUserController userController = gameAnvilManager.UserController; try { ResultCodeMatchUserCancel result = await userController.MatchUserCancel("RoomType"); if (result == ResultCodeMatchUserCancel.MATCH_USER_CANCEL_SUCCESS) { // 성공 } else { // 실패 } } catch (Exception e) { // 예외 } } ```

In response, ResultCodeMatchUserCancel will be returned, and if the cancellation succeeds, it becomes ResultCodeMatchUserCancel.MATCH\_USER\_CANCEL\_SUCCESS, and if not, the cancellation fails. If user matching is not in progress, the request may fail if user matching has already succeeded or a timeout occurred.

ResultCodeMatchUserCancel details are as follows:

| Name | Value | Description |
|---------------------------- |---- |---------------------------- |
| PARSE\_ERROR | -2 | Packet Parsing Error. This can occur if the server and client versions are different. |
| TIMEOUT | -1 | Timeout. The request will not be responded within the set time. |
| SYSTEM\_ERROR | 1 | Server System Error. Failed due to an unknown server error. |
| INVALID\_PROTOCOL | 2 | Protocol unregistered on the server. An unregistered protocol was used in the additional information. |
| MATCH\_USER\_CANCEL\_SUCCESS | 0 | success. |
| MATCH\_USER\_CANCEL\_FAIL | 1201 | Failed. User code denied. |
| MATCH\_USER\_CANCEL\_FAIL\_ALREADY\_JOINED\_ROOM | 1202 | Failed. Already in the room. |
| MATCH\_USER\_CANCEL\_FAIL\_NOT\_IN\_PROGRESS | 1203 | Failed. User matchmaking is not in progress. |
